# Carbonify — Release Notes

## 2026-07-25 — Profile loading is more resilient

**Headline:** a slow or failed profile load no longer makes you look like a lower-privileged
user, and the app now tells you when it's retrying.

- **Your role no longer flickers on a bad connection.** If loading your profile times out or
  fails, the app keeps your last-known role and retries in the background, instead of silently
  treating you as a basic user — which had been hiding admin and staff controls until a reload.
- **A clear "couldn't load your profile" signal.** When a load fails you'll see a short banner,
  plus a small marker on your avatar and a note in the account menu. All of them clear
  themselves once your profile loads.
- **New accounts always get a complete profile.** Fixed a case where a freshly created account
  could come back with an empty profile (blank name, default role).

### For operators
- The signup-trigger migration `20260723000100_profile_on_signup.sql` **was applied to the live
  project on 2026-07-25**. It guarantees every account has a profile row; the change above is
  the client-side safety net for when one still can't be read.

## 2026-07-23 — New navigation, and access-control fixes

**Headline:** signed-in users now navigate from a single grouped sidebar on the left,
and three access-control bugs around sign-in and roles were fixed.

### New navigation
- **One sidebar for everything.** Every feature a role can use is listed in a grouped
  left sidebar, in one place, under one name. Previously the same page could appear as
  "Buy credits" in one menu and "Marketplace" in another. The header now carries only
  your cart, notifications, and avatar; the avatar menu holds only account settings.
- **Collapsible sidebar.** The three-line button beside the logo widens or narrows the
  sidebar on desktop and opens it as a drawer on mobile.
- **Tidier developer project list.** Projects collapse to one row each, grouped by what
  needs your attention — "Needs your action", "In review", "Live", "Closed".

### Access-control fixes
- **The public marketplace is public again.** Browsing the marketplace and opening a
  project link no longer forces you to sign in first.
- **Admin accounts can sign in.** A `super_admin` account was being caught in a redirect
  loop and could not reach the app; it now lands on the admin dashboard.
- **Buying pages are limited to buyers.** Staff roles (admin, verifier, project developer)
  can no longer open the cart or checkout pages that don't apply to them.
- **Clearer sign-up and sign-in.** Registration now tells you when to check your email for
  a confirmation link, and when an address is already registered, instead of always saying
  "account created". Signing out no longer resets your theme or language.

### For operators
- One database migration ships with this release, `20260723000100_profile_on_signup.sql`,
  which guarantees every new account gets a profile row. **Applied to the live project on
  2026-07-25** — see HANDOFF.md §0.5.

## 2026-07-03 — Server-authoritative money path (complete & hardened)

**Headline:** the entire money path now runs on the server and is locked down. Every money
movement — buying with a card, GCash/Maya, or wallet balance; topping up the wallet;
checking out a cart; retiring credits; and subscribing — settles server-side and the books
reconcile to zero. This closes the platform's biggest production risk (client-controlled
payment amounts) and hardens the financial tables so the browser can no longer write them.

### Highlights
- **Server-authoritative checkout.** The client sends only `{ listing_id, quantity }`; the
  amount is recomputed on the server from the listing price. A client can no longer set the
  price it pays.
- **Signed webhook as the source of truth.** The PayMongo webhook verifies an HMAC-SHA256
  signature (with a replay window and event de-duplication) and settles each payment
  atomically via database functions. It fails closed.
- **Double-entry ledger + reconciliation.** Every settlement writes balanced ledger entries;
  `reconcile_financials()` reports drift and returns **0 rows** when healthy.
- **Financial tables are now server-write-only.** Row-Level Security keeps reads working but
  blocks all direct client writes to `credit_transactions`, `credit_ownership`,
  `wallet_accounts`, and `wallet_transactions`. Writes happen only through
  `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs or the service-role webhook.
- **Sellers can get paid.** Escrow, a KYB-gated payout state machine, refunds, and disputes
  are all wired and proven.

### Verified flows (each with `reconcile_financials()` = 0 rows, after the RLS lockdown)
| Flow | Result |
|---|---|
| Card purchase | ✅ |
| Wallet top-up | ✅ |
| Wallet purchase | ✅ |
| Cart (2 items) | ✅ |
| Retire credits | ✅ |
| Subscription upgrade | ✅ |

### Fixes in this release
Four objects that existed only in the live database (never in version control) were surfaced
by the first real end-to-end runs and are now committed as idempotent migrations
(`20260703000000`–`20260703000200`):
- **`update_wallet_balance_atomic`** — the wallet top-up settlement function was called by the
  webhook but defined in no migration. Added.
- **`wallet_transactions.external_reference`** — a missing column that broke the top-up audit
  row and the callback confirmation. Added (with an index).
- **Retirement `project_id` bug** — the Retire page passed the wrong identifier to the retire
  function, causing a false "insufficient credits". Fixed.
- **Stray `credit_ownership_quantity_positive` (> 0) constraint** — blocked retirement's
  zero-out write; replaced with the intended `>= 0` guard.

Also: retiring credits now shows an in-app toast instead of a blocking browser alert.

### Documentation added
- **Per-role user guides** — step-by-step how-to for every role: [user-guide/](user-guide/README.md).
- **Developer docs** — setup, environment variables, architecture, database & RPCs, deployment,
  testing, contributing, and security: [dev/](dev/README.md).

### Verification
ESLint 0 · 145 unit tests passing · production build green · all six money flows reconcile to 0
after the lockdown.

### Known limitations (not code — need an external party or ops/legal)
- Real registry/supplier integration (Verra / Gold Standard / Carbonmark / Patch).
- AML / sanctions screening (needs a data vendor).
- Independent penetration test before using live payment keys; backups/PITR; observability.
- Legal entity, licensed PSP/EMI partnership, BIR registration, accredited third-party verifier.
- VAT invoices are **provisional** until the operating entity is BIR-registered.
