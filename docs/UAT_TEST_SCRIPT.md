# Carbonify — Test Script for Every Role

**Simple, step-by-step tests for the closed beta.** Each test has a **name/ID**, a goal, the steps, and
what "pass" looks like. Tick the box when it passes. If a step fails, write down which test ID and what
happened.

> **Before you start**
> - This is **test mode** — no real money moves.
> - When any step asks for card payment, use the **test card: `4343 4343 4343 4345`**, any future expiry
>   date, any 3-digit CVC.
> - You'll need one account per role. The **Admin** creates/approves the special roles (Verifier and LGU
>   are set by Admin; Farmer and Developer are applied for and approved).
> - After every payment test, the Admin runs the health check **ADMIN-05** — the books must balance.

## How to record results

For each test, mark **Pass** or **Fail**. For a fail, note:
- The **test ID** (e.g. `BUY-05`)
- What you **expected** vs what **happened**
- A screenshot if possible

The most important single check is **ADMIN-05** — if the books ever fail to balance after a payment
test, stop and report it before continuing.
