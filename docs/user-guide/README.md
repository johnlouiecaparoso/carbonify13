# Carbonify User Guide

Welcome to Carbonify, the Philippine carbon-credit registry and marketplace. This guide set explains, step by step, how to use the app: creating an account, verifying your identity, buying and retiring carbon credits, developing and verifying projects, and administering the platform.

## How to read these guides

- **Start with [Getting Started](01-getting-started.md).** It applies to *everyone*, no matter your role. It covers signing up, logging in, two-factor authentication (2FA), identity verification (KYC), your profile, plans, and how to find your way around.
- **Then read the guide for your role.** Each role guide assumes you have already done the Getting Started steps.
- **Watch for the "Prerequisites" line** at the top of gated flows. It tells you what you need (a confirmed account, a role, or a KYC level) before a feature will work.

## Accounts, roles, and KYC — the three things that unlock features

Access in Carbonify is controlled by three separate ideas. Understanding them upfront saves a lot of confusion:

1. **Account** — you must be signed in for anything beyond public pages (Home, About, Marketplace, Registry, Market dashboard, and public certificate verification).
2. **Role** — your role decides which workspaces and tools you see. Everyone starts as a **General User**. You can apply for **Project Developer** or **Verifier** at `/apply`, register as an **LGU User**, and an **Administrator** grants roles. (See the role table below.)
3. **KYC level** — identity verification is a *separate* gate from your role. You must reach at least **KYC Level 1 (Basic)** before you can buy or trade credits, regardless of role.

> Note: Some roles are **finance-restricted**. Administrators, Verifiers, and Project Developers cannot use the buyer-only finance pages (Wallet, Certificates, Receipts, Carbon Calculator) — those are for buyers and general users.
