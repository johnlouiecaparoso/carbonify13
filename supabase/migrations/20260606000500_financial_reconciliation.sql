-- Phase 1.6 — Internal financial reconciliation (drift detection) + derived balances.
--
-- This reconciles the system against ITSELF (intents vs transactions vs ledger vs
-- webhook events). External reconciliation against PayMongo's settlement report
-- is a follow-up that needs the PayMongo API (tracked in DEFERRED_BACKLOG.md).
--
-- Both objects are server/admin-only (the underlying ledger is deny-all to clients).

-- Derived per-account balances (balances are never stored; always summed).
