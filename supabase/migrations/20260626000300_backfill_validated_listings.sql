-- ============================================================================
-- Make validated projects appear in the marketplace (and backfill existing ones).
--
-- The marketplace shows a project only when it has an ACTIVE credit_listing ->
-- project_credits -> project whose status is validated/approved. That row is
-- created by trg_activate_validated_project when a verifier validates a project
-- (migration 20260602001000). If validated projects aren't showing, either that
-- trigger isn't installed on this DB, or the projects were validated before it
-- existed (the trigger only fires on the status transition, not retroactively).
--
-- This migration:
--   1. Re-installs activate_validated_project_trigger (idempotent; also updates
--      the verification standard label EcoLink -> Carbonify).
--   2. Backfills project_credits + an active credit_listing for every already
--      validated/approved project that is missing them.
-- Safe to run repeatedly: every insert is guarded by NOT EXISTS.
