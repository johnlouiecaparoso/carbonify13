-- ============================================================================
-- Fix credit pool availability — write the column the app actually reads.
--
-- project_credits has two pool columns from schema drift: credits_available
-- (read by the marketplace listing query AND process_marketplace_purchase) and
-- available_credits (written by the activate-on-validation trigger). Because the
-- trigger filled available_credits but NOT credits_available, validated projects
-- showed "All credits have been bought" even with zero sales, and a purchase
-- would mis-read the pool.
--
-- This:
--   1. Re-defines activate_validated_project_trigger to keep BOTH columns in
--      sync (credits_available is the source of truth).
--   2. Repairs existing project_credits behind an ACTIVE listing whose
--      credits_available is null/0 but that have NO completed sales, restoring
--      the pool from available_credits / total_credits / the project's estimate.
-- Idempotent and conservative: only rows with no completed transactions are
-- touched, so genuinely sold-out listings are left alone.
