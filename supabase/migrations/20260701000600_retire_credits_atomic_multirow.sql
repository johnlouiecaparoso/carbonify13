-- Retirement: retire across MULTIPLE ownership rows (bug fix).
--
-- The previous retire_credits_atomic decremented a single credit_ownership row
-- (limit 1). Because each purchase creates its own ownership row, a buyer's
-- credits for one project are usually split across several rows — so retiring an
-- amount larger than any single row (or simply summing to enough across rows)
-- wrongly failed with "insufficient credits". This version checks the TOTAL for
-- the project and decrements across rows (oldest first) until satisfied.
