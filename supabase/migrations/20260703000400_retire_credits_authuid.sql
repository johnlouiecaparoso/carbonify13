-- ============================================================================
-- Hardening — retire_credits_atomic must bind identity to the JWT, not a
-- client-passed p_user_id.
--
-- The previous body used `coalesce(auth.uid(), p_user_id)`, so if auth.uid()
-- were ever null (e.g. the execute grant is widened to anon, or the function is
-- called in a context without a JWT) a caller could retire ANOTHER user's
-- credits by passing their id. As granted today (authenticated only) it is not
-- exploitable, but retirement destroys credits and mints offset claims, so this
-- removes the fragile fallback: identity is auth.uid(), and a null uid is
-- rejected. p_user_id is ignored for identity (kept in the signature for
-- backward compatibility with the existing client call).
--
-- Behaviour for legitimate users is unchanged (auth.uid() is always set for an
-- authenticated PostgREST call and equals the id the client passes).
-- Re-verify retirement (flow E) after applying: reconcile_financials() = 0.
